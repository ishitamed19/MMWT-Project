<li><h2>Bosphorus Cruise</h2><br>
<p>A trip to Istanbul is not complete without a Bosphorus cruise. Not only provides it a nice overview of the city, both the European and Asian shores of the famous waterway have a lot to offer – century old palaces and mansions galore.
There are several cruises you can take: a short one (to the second suspension bridge and back), a long one (all the way to the Black Sea and back), and a sunset tour in summertime.The latter used to be my favorite, but became victim of its success. These days I prefer to take the full Bosphorus day tour, or the shorter version if you are pressed for time.</p>
<li><h2>Topkapi Palace</h2><br>
<p>opkapi Palace (Topkapi Sarayi) is rightfully a sight you can’t afford to miss while in Istanbul. This complex of kiosks and pavilions contained by four lush green courtyards is where generations of sultans had their principal residence for almost half a century.
Top attractions at Topkapi Palace are the Harem, an adorned ‘cage’ of the sultan’s women, the treasury storing the crown jewels and containing the famous Topkapi dagger, and the weapon’s room boosting their fine craftsmanship even when it came to making swords and bows.Also, don’t forget to walk all the way till the end for breathtaking views of the Sea of Marmara, Bosphorus and Golden Horn.</p>
<li><h2>The Museum of Turkish and Islamic Arts</h2><br>
<p>The Museum of Turkish and Islamic Arts is much more exciting than the name reveals. Housed in the former palace of Ibrahim Pasa — the most talented Grand Vizier of Süleyman — and overlooking the Hippodrome, the collection has over 40.000 items on display.
Each room concentrates on a different period or area of the Islamic world, also reflecting daily Turkish life from the 8th till the 19th century. Top features are the world renowned collection of gigantic carpets hanging from the ceiling, a recreation of a Turkic nomadic tent, and the peaceful Turkish coffee house where they brew Turkish coffee over an open fire.</p>
<li><h2>The Chora Church</h2><br>
<p> The Chora Church, Church of St Savior, or Kariye Museum is a bit off the beaten track, but well worth a visit. Located in Chora/Edirnekapi next to the old city walls, it is one of the most amazing religious building Istanbul has to offer.
The walls and ceilings of this church are adorned with stunning Byzantine mosaics and fabulous frescoes. Some are considered as the most significant in the Christian world.</p>
