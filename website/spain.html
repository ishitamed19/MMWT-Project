<ul>
<li><h2>Alhambra in Granada</h2><br>
<p>This giant fortress will take an entire day to walk around, but make sure you do it as you will find it as a highlight on any European guide on things to do. The first Nasrid king, El Ahmar, chose this building as it overlooked the entire city of Granada, offering you a great view for some quick snaps. The price for entry is around 13 euro’s, while it is about 9 euro’s for children (I’m pretty certain they offer student discount if that helps). Alhambra is only ever fully open between March and October, so make sure you time your visit perfectly, as you would be disappointed through the winter.</p>
<li><h2> Ski the Sierra Nevada Mountains</h2><br>
<p>If you are staying in Malaga then you actually have a relatively short journey before you can get your ski’s on. The Sierra Nevada ski resorts are famous worldwide due to the fact that you can ski in the mountains and then head down to the beach to get a tan all within the same day. Don’t be fooled into thinking that this makes any difference on the ski resort as it is definitely one of the best you will find in Europe, despite the contrast of weather in such a close distance.</p>
<li><h2>See Gaudi’s architecture in Barcelona</h2><br>
<p>The highlight of Gaudi’s work can be found in Parc Guell, which holds a number of his structures. Gaudi is known and respected around the world and was regularly influenced by forms of nature, which is definitely evident in the curves through all of his architecture. Casa Batllo is also worth a visit, a beautiful building designed by Gaudi, really illustrating how different he was to his contemporaries.</p>
<li><h2>Aqueduct, Segovia</h2><br>
<p>This roman aqueduct has been in place for 2,000 years stretching 800m long. A visit to the aqueduct makes for some great photos, yet it will only take a few hours, therefore you will still have plenty of time to head back and raid the tapas bars.</p>
<li><h2>Views of Ronda</h2><br>
<p>A magnificent bridge spans the gorge between the new town and the old town, which you can find through taking a picturesque drive through the Andalucía mountains. If you plan on visiting, make sure your camera is fully charged as the images are unbelievable.</p>
