<li><h2>Burj Khalifa</h2><br>
<p>Dubai has the glitziest, the widest, the deepest and Burj Khalifa - the world's tallest building. Check out the exhibit on the building's history, then take the fastest lift in the world. Hold on to your hat - it only takes a few seconds. It is not for the faint-hearted but is well worth it, as the views will blow your mind. If you are a passionate photographer, as I am, you can even take a tripod with you to shoot the views out towards the beach and over the city. Book tickets online in advance and go at sunset, which is my favourite time as you get to see both day and night from the top.</p>
<li><h2> Dubai Creek</h2><br>
<p>After the world's tallest building, we love the contrast of a simple abra ride on Dubai Creek. The creek is one of Dubai's oldest and most beautiful areas. Nothing can match the sheer joy of riding an abra across the creek for just one dirham at sunset, as the evening call to prayer is singing out across the mosque minarets. Close your eyes and you could be back in the 1960s when the city began. You can even charter a private abra for £10/hour.</P>
<li><h2> The Sheikh Mohammed Centre for Cultural Understanding</h2><br>
<p> A great place for breakfast or lunch, with a twist! If you've always wanted to know about Islam but were too afraid to ask, here's your chance to get the low-down. For example, why do women wear an abaya? How long can camels survive in the desert? Why do Muslims face a certain way to pray? All the answers came from here, and more specifically the centre's charismatic host, Nasif. Don’t be surprised if you leave with a whole new understanding and appreciation of the Muslim world.

<li><h2>Burj Al Arab</h2><br>
<p>The Burj calls itself ‘the world's only 7-star hotel' and, whether or not you agree, it certainly one of the most iconic buildings in Dubai.

Soaring to a height of 321 metres, the Burj is designed to resemble a billowing sail. There are various viewpoints from which you can take photos but one of the best is from the public beach next to it. From here you will get the ultimate Dubai shot of you on the beach with the Burj in the background. It is one of the most photographed structures in the world, and consistently voted the world's most luxurious hotel. It is too expensive for the average visitor so here's a little secret tip for you: go for a drink at the Dhow and Anchor in the hotel opposite (Jumeirah Beach hotel) and sit out on the terrace for an even better view – but don't tell anyone!</P>
<li><h2> Jumeirah Beach Residence Walk and Dubai Marina</h2><br>
<p>Built in the last few years, Dubai Marina throngs with spectacular twisting skyscrapers, while just next door is Jumeirah Beach Residence walk (or 'JBR walk' if you want to sound like a local). The Marina and JBR is a city within a city with amazing architecture, pretty café and bars - ideal for people-watching, high-end hotels and some of the best restaurants in the city, including Frankie Dettori's Frankie's Italian Bar and Grill and Gary Rhodes' Twenty10.
