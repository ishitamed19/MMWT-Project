<li><h2>The London Eye</h2><br>
<p>Yes, it’s a giant ferris wheel, and, yes, it’s for tourists — but it’s a worth a spin. Once you’ve boarded your glass-sided capsule — each capsule holds 25 people — it will be a half-hour before you get back down. Creeping along at 0.6 miles (0.9 km) per hour, it’s an excruciatingly slow flight, as a trip on the London Eye is called, but from the top of the 443-foot (135-m) wheel you’ll be rewarded with gloriously unimpeded views over London. At night, take one of the special “champagne flights,” and you’ll find yourself in one of the capital’s best bars. Continue a scenic theme with dinner and drinks at Skylon, a dimly lit lounge and restaurant overlooking the Thames with floor-to-ceiling windows.</p>
<li><h2>Kensington Gardens</h2><br>
<p>Londoners of a certain age will tell you that Germans shaped their city. They’re right, but the Blitz wasn’t the only thing that left its mark on London. In 1728, Caroline of Brandenburg-Ansbach, the German-born wife of King George II, commissioned works to the southern swath of Hyde Park — later redesignated Kensington Gardens — creating the Serpentine, an artificial lake, and landscaping the surrounding lawns and walkways. (A stately circuit of these ornamental waters will take you 40 minutes, and you can swim at the Serpentine Lido from May to September.) Queen Caroline lived in Kensington Palace, on the western edge of the park, which has been home to assorted members of the extended royal family and household, but will, of course, forever be associated with its most iconic resident, Princess Diana. Kensington Gardens is studded with shrines to the late Princess, including a fountain dedicated to her memory by the Queen in 2004.</p>
<li><h2>Tate Modern</h2><br>
<p>Many Britons regard high culture with suspicion. Yet this gallery devoted to modern art effortlessly pulls in the punters and locals as well as the tourists, and ranks among London’s most-visited attractions. Part of its appeal is the building itself, fashioned by architects Herzog and De Meuron from a vast disused power station on the Thames’s south bank. In addition to blockbuster exhibits and live events, the gallery invites a prominent artist every year to transform its cavernous turbine hall: Chinese artist and dissident Ai Wei Wei blanketed the space with 100 million hand-sculpted and painted porcelain sunflower seeds in 2010; British artist Tacita Dean paid homage to 35mm filmmaking in 2011 with her 11-minute loop of grainy, flickering images projected onto a towering screen at the rear of the hall.It would be easy to spend the entire day in the gallery, but you might want to get out and walk around the neighborhood: Enter foodie heaven in nearby Borough Market, where the delis and restaurants are open all week and a farmer’s market operates Friday and Saturday. Directly across the river from the Tate is St Paul’s Cathedral, Sir Christopher Wren’s most celebrated building. To get there you cross the £18.2 million Millennium Bridge, a suspension footbridge completed in 2000, which quickly gained the sobriquet the “Wobbly Bridge.” (They’ve since fixed the wobble.)</p>
<li><h2>Hyde Park</h2><br>
<p>At 145 hectares, Hyde Park is central London’s largest open space. Henry VIII expropriated it from the Church in 1536, when it became a hunting ground and later a venue for duels, executions and horse racing. The 1851 Great Exhibition was held here, and during WWII the park became an enormous potato field. These days, it’s an occasional concert venue (Bruce Springsteen, The Rolling Stones, Madonna) and a full-time green space for fun and frolics, including boating on the Serpentine .</p>
<li><h2>Tower of London</h2><br>
<p>Despite the Tower of London’s grim reputation as a place of torture and death, within these walls you will also discover the history of a royal palace, an armoury and a powerful fortress. Don’t miss Royal Beasts and learn about the wild and wonderous animals that have inhabited the Tower, making it the first London Zoo.Discover the priceless Crown Jewels newly displayed in 2012, join an iconic Beefeater on a tour and hear their bloody tales, stand where famous heads have rolled, learn the legend of the Tower’s ravens, storm the battlements and get to grips with swords and armour and much more!</p>
