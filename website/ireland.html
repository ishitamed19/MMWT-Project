<li><h2>Fly Falcons at Dromoland Castle</h2><br>
<p>Falconry was a sport of choice among medieval nobility so it makes sense for Dromoland Castle to offer a School of Falconry—it’s the ancestral home of the O’Briens descendants of Brian Boru High King of Ireland in the 11th century. On this private experience with falconer and hawk you walk through the wooded castle demesne launching a trained hawk skyward and calling it back to your gloved fist as the chieftains did back in the day.
There has been a castle here for a thousand years that was rebuilt several times; the last major renovations turned it into a luxury hotel that opened in 1963. Here chivalry is not forgotten (there’s even a suit of armor in the entry hall); dinners are multi-course feasts with paired wines and resident harpist; and the attentive service is kingly. Suites are large and comfortable; some are located in the castle’s turrets. Falconry is just one of the estate pursuits which also include pony and trap rides clay pigeon shooting fishing horse riding lessons and a par-72 Ron Kirby-designed golf course.

<li><h2>Drive the Wild Atlantic Way</h2><br>
<p>This new touring route takes in the entire western seacoast of Ireland offering stunning vistas a rugged coastline charming villages tearooms pubs ancient ruined castles and photo ops. The Wild Atlantic Way is reportedly the longest defined coastal drive in the world. It covers over 1500 miles from Inishowen Peninsula County Donegal in the north to Kinsale County Cork in the south with many additional loops and diversions. The route is signposted and features more than 150 "Discovery Points" such as the 1972-foot-high sea cliffs of Slieve League in Donegal that are nearly three times higher than the Cliffs of Moher and Mizen Head Signal Station on Ireland’s most southwesterly point. Included are opportunities to experience Irelands heritage perhaps at Limerick’s King John's Castle; taste local delicacies like Galway oysters; head out on an adventure such as surfing Bundoran in County Donegal; and take in music at events like the Willie Clancy Festival in Milltown Malbay County Clare. It’s far more than a driving route.</p>
<li><h2>Try a True Links Course</h2><br>
<p>One third of the world’s seaside links courses (more than 50) ring the coastline of Ireland where golfers are spoiled for choice. Links courses—one of the first types of golf courses—are notoriously tricky. Golfers have to thread the ball through sand dunes that can reach 200 feet high and hit tiny greens topping sea grass-tufted dunes while dealing with wind currents and changeable weather.
Topping the list of links courses is Northern Ireland’s Royal Portrush Golf Club established in 1888 home course of Darren Clarke winner of the 2011 British Open and Graeme McDowell winner of the 2010 U.S. Open. Ballybunion Golf Club in County Kerry established in 1893 is former U.S. President Bill Clinton’s favorite (there’s a statue in town of him swinging an iron) and the Old Course was included in Golf Magazine’s top 20 courses of the world in 2011. Waterville Golf Club on the Ring of Kerry is Tiger Woods’s Ireland favorite—he has played it to prepare for the British Open which he won three times as part of his 14 major championship wins. Paul McGinley European team captain for the 2014 Ryder Cup chooses his home course County Louth Golf Club known as “Baltray” north of Dublin as his favorite. There are some 400 additional golf courses in Ireland and best of all anyone can play them regardless of handicap or connections.</p>
<li><h2>Sample Cork’s Artisanal Food</h2><br>
<p>The English Market in Cork’s city center is a roofed food emporium showcasing regional Irish ingredients and artisanal food offerings. It’s also a destination for shopping noshing lunching and people-watching (Queen Elizabeth II visited in 2011). Established in 1788 it originally helped provision fleets in the harbor and through years of economic hardship the famine the Irish War of Independence and the Civil War the English Market kept its doors open. When the economy improved in the 1990s a new food culture influenced by Europe got under way based around naturally and locally produced food with the English Market at the epicenter. Here craft butchers offer free-range duck organic chicken and traditional black pudding; fishmongers sell wild-caught fish from nearby Castletownbere; and growers display gooseberries and blackberries. There are artisanal producers of goat’s cheese soda bread charcuterie chutney chocolate and cakes. The Farmgate Café on the upstairs balcony features some of the market’s best: potato and wild garlic soup St. Tola goat’s cheese salad corned beef bread-and-butter pudding. It’s sustenance with a story.</p>
<li><h2>Toast Literary Dublin</h2><br>
<p>Many literary figures have called Dublin home and each had a favorite pub where they spent a great deal of non-writing time. On the Dublin Literary Pub Crawl two actors perform prose poetry and theatrical scenes by writers affiliated with four historic pubs. It’s a fun rollick around the city mixing literary entertainment with liquid libation.
The crawl starts at The Duke founded in 1822 where Patrick Kavanagh frequented then moves on to O’Neill’s a favorite of Brendan Behan. Revolutionary leader Michael Collins drank at The Old Stand and James Joyce drank at Davy Byrnes as a student later setting an episode in Ulysses in the pub in which Leopold Bloom has a Gorgonzola sandwich and a glass of Burgundy. In this UNESCO City of Literature visitors can also take in the Dublin Writers Museum and the James Joyce Centre; take part in Bloomsday (June 16) festivities that follow events in Joyce’s Ulysses; visit Oscar Wilde’s statue reclining on a boulder in Merrion Square; and attend the Dublin Writers Festival in May to catch up with current authors.</p>
